  Abstract-- Consider the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) interfering broadcast channel whereby multiple base stations in a cellular network simultaneously transmit signals to a group of users in their own cells while causing interference to each other. The basic problem is to design linear beamformers that can maximize the system throughput. In this paper, we propose a linear transceiver design algorithm for weighted sum-rate maximization that is based on iterative minimization of weighted mean-square error (MSE). The proposed algorithm only needs local channel knowledge and converges to a stationary point of the weighted sum-rate maximization problem. Furthermore, the algorithm and its convergence can be extended to a general class of sum-utility maximization problem. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated by numerical experiments.
